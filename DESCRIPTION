Description: Routines to handle family data with a pedigree object (2014, <doi: 10.1159/000363105>). The initial purpose was to create correlation structures that describe family relationships such as kinship and identity-by-descent, which can be used to model family data in mixed effects models, such as in the coxme function. Also includes a tool for pedigree drawing which is focused on producing compact layouts without intervention. Recent additions include utilities to trim the pedigree object with various criteria, and kinship for the X chromosome.
