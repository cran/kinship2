<div id="introduction" class="section level1">
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>The pedigree routines came out of a simple need – to quickly draw a
pedigree structure on the screen, within R, that was ``good enough’’ to
help with debugging the actual routines of interest, which were those
for fitting mixed effecs Cox models to large family data. As such the
routine had compactness and automation as primary goals; complete
annotation (monozygous twins, multiple types of affected status) and
most certainly elegance were not on the list. Other software could do
that much better.</p>
<p>It therefore came as a major surprise when these routines proved
useful to others. Through their constant feedback, application to more
complex pedigrees, and ongoing requests for one more feature, the
routine has become what it is today. This routine is still not suitable
for really large pedigrees, nor for heavily inbred ones such as in
animal studies, and will likely not evolve in that way. The authors
fondest hope is that others will pick up the project.</p>
</div>
<div id="pedigree-constructor" class="section level1">
<h1>Pedigree Constructor</h1>
The pedigree function is the first step, creating an object of class
pedigree.<br />
It accepts the following input
<p>The [[famid]] variable is placed last as it was a later addition to
the code; thus prior invocations of the function that use positional
arguments will not be affected.<br />
If present, this allows a set of pedigrees to be generated, one per
family. The resultant structure will be an object of class
[[pedigreeList]].</p>
<p>Note that a factor variable is not listed as one of the choices for
the subject identifier. This is on purpose. Factors were designed to
accomodate character strings whose values came from a limited class –
things like race or gender, and are not appropriate for a subject
identifier. All of their special properties as compared to a character
variable turn out to be backwards for this case, in particular a memory
of the original level set when subscripting is done.</p>
<p>However, due to the awful decision early on in S to automatically
turn every character into a factor — unless you stood at the door with a
club to head the package off — most users have become ingrained to the
idea of using them for every character variable. (I encourage you to set
the global option stringsAsFactors=FALSE to turn off autoconversion – it
will measurably improve your R experience). Therefore, to avoid
unnecessary hassle for our users the code will accept a factor as input
for the id variables, but the final structure does not retain it.<br />
Gender and relation do become factors. Status follows the pattern of the
survival routines and remains an integer.</p>
<p>We will describe the code in a set of blocks.</p>
<div id="data-checks-and-errors" class="section level2">
<h2>Data Checks and Errors</h2>
<div id="errors1" class="section level3">
<h3>Errors1</h3>
<p>The code starts out with some checks on the input data.<br />
Is it all the same length, are the codes legal, etc. Checks for ids
being non-missing, and for sex to be as expected of the codes 1-4 for
female/male/unknown/terminated.</p>
</div>
<div id="errors2" class="section level3">
<h3>Errors2</h3>
<p>Create the variables descibing a missing father and/or mother, which
is what we expect both for people at the top of the pedigree and for
marry-ins, adding in the family id information. It is easier to do it
first. If there are multiple families in the pedigree, make a working
set of identifiers that are of the form `family/subject’. Family
identifiers can be factor, character, or numeric.</p>
</div>
<div id="errors3-parents" class="section level3">
<h3>Errors3-Parents</h3>
<p>Next check that any mother or father identifiers are found in the
identifier list, and are of the right sex. Subjects who don’t have a
mother or father are founders. For those people both of the parents
should be missing.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="creation-of-pedigrees" class="section level2">
<h2>Creation of Pedigrees</h2>
<p>Now, paste the parts together into a basic pedigree. The fields for
father and mother are not the identifiers of the parents, but their row
number in the structure.</p>
</div>
<div id="finish-object" class="section level2">
<h2>Finish Object</h2>
<p>The final structure will be in the order of the original data, and
all the components except [[relation]] will have the same number of rows
as the original data.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="subscipting" class="section level1">
<h1>Subscipting</h1>
<p>Subscripting of a pedigree list extracts one or more families from
the list. We treat character subscripts in the same way that dimnames on
a matrix are used. Factors are a problem though: assume that we have a
vector x with names <code>joe&#39;&#39;,</code>charlie’‘, ``fred’’, then
[[x[‘joe’]]] is the first element of the vector, but [[temp &lt;-
factor(‘joe’, ‘charlie’, ‘fred’); z &lt;- temp[1]; x[z] ]] will be the
second element! R is implicitly using as.numeric on factors when they
are a subscript; this caught an early version of the code when an
element of a data frame was used to index the pedigree: characters are
turned into factors when bundled into a data frame.</p>
<pre><code>          Note:
              \begin{enumerate}
            \item What should we do if the family id is a numeric: when the user
            says [4] do they mean the fourth family in the list or family &#39;4&#39;?
              The user is responsible to say [&#39;4&#39;] in this case.
            \item  In a normal vector invalid subscripts give an NA, e.g. (1:3)[6], but
            since there is no such object as an ``NA pedigree&#39;&#39;, we emit an error
            for this.
            \item The [[drop]] argument has no meaning for pedigrees, but must to be
            a defined argument of any subscript method; we simply ignore it.
            \item Updating the father/mother is a minor nuisance;
            since they must are integer indices to rows they must be
            recreated after selection.  Ditto for the relationship matrix.  
            \end{enumerate}
              For a pedigree, the subscript operator extracts a subset of individuals.
            We disallow selections that retain only 1 of a subject&#39;s parents, since    %&#39;
            they cause plotting trouble later.
            Relations are worth keeping only if both parties in the relation were
            selected.</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="as-data.frame-for-pedigree" class="section level1">
<h1>As Data.Frame for Pedigree</h1>
<pre><code>            Convert the pedigree to a data.frame so it is easy to view when removing or
            trimming individuals with their various indicators.  
            The relation and hints elements of the pedigree object are not easy to
            put in a data.frame with one entry per subject. These items are one entry 
            per subject, so are put in the returned data.frame:  id, findex, mindex, 
            sex, affected, status.  The findex and mindex are converted to the actual id
            of the parents rather than the index.
            
            Can be used with as.data.frame(ped) or data.frame(ped). Specify in Namespace
            file that it is an S3 method.
            
            
            This function is useful for checking the pedigree object with the
            $findex$ and $mindex$ vector instead of them replaced with the ids of 
            the parents.  This is not currently included in the package.</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="printing-pedigree" class="section level1">
<h1>Printing Pedigree</h1>
<pre><code>            It usually doesn&#39;t make sense to print a pedigree, since the id is just   %&#39;
            a repeat of the input data and the family connections are pointers.
            Thus we create a simple summary.</code></pre>
